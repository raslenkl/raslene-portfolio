# Raslen Klai – Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!  
I’m a Tunisian student at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), pursuing a Bachelor of Software Engineering with Honours – Multimedia System Development  (expected graduation: 2027).  
My work bridges **software engineering, game development, and mobile applications**, with projects ranging from student community platforms to experimental indie games.
I also have experience with editing (davinci resolve) and Youtube (Philosphy side project).
